# SBA318
 (Its late at night so please bear with me here)
 
 This one was hard and im not sure what really stuck with me, but this is a express server application that was hard to make and required so so so much research as I am really new to this. A lot of these techniques were used for the first time and im glad it kind of worked out but, I need to take some time to understand backend development more...

 Anyways, to use this page ... 
 I'm not actually sure...  I guess its an API where you can request data and have it sent back. You can access a few different arrays containing basic data. You can also update some of the data or delete specific areas of the data. There is also a form you can fill out to add to the data... There are three data types... As you can see I just made sure I met the requirements as best as I could. writing this README is one of the requirements. 
 
 If there is anything I learned it would be that backend development is similar to dealing with ghosts... They're there but at the same time They're not. Sorry to those who know what I mean. Its tough (for now)  

Either way, please enjoy this project. May you enjoy it more than I did when making it.

goodnight :D
